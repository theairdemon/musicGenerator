# Genres
To better create specific variations among the music that is generation, it makes sense to make different weighted probabilities for a few genres of music, which will hopefully make it easier to feel like that's the type of song we're listening to.

## Anime
To me, the *anime* genre means something in-between pop, classical, and indie rock. The primary instrument for the melody would be piano and/or violins, with cellos for the harmonies/chords and woodwinds playing secondary melodies on top.

### Anime - Rhythm
The *anime* genre should rhythmically have some repetition between measures, but it's not a guarantee for every song. Verse-to-verse, we want some differences, but we also want to be able to revist previous rhymic ideas later in the song. I think the most imnportant rhytmic repetition will occur in the first half of the measures; this will tie the structure for each verse together quite nicely. We want the fourth measure to have a smaller probability of repeating, as it should be the end of our "breath" for this verse.

To keep things moving, we don't want any 1/2 notes at all. We can retain 1/16 notes, but they shouldn't appear very frequently. 1/4 and 1/8 notes can appear with the same frequency, since we know we'll be trying to double-up 1/8 notes.


## Classical
The genre of *classical* music has so much variation, so much history, that
 attempting to define it within the bounds of a few paragraphs would be a 
Sisyphean endeavor. Instead, we'll define a general "feeling" of classical 
music, where a song could sound similar to the pop-culture concept of a 
classical piece. For me, this genre of *classical* music could have either long flowing runs, or short, staccato notes - potentially both in the same song. A key component is in the instrumentation; we can have any single instrument (or rotation of instruments) taking the lead melody, but we want a full orchestral mix for harmonies and chords. A suite of pianos, strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion  instruments will create the sense of space that this genre needs.

## Classical - Rhythm
The more important repetition for the classical *genre* will appear in the melody; but to allow that to flourish, we should have some chance of repeating the first half of measures 1, 2, or 3, in any combination. Of course, this shouldn't be a guarantee, and there will be some variation amongst the generated pieces. In general, we want movement and charisma throughout the piece; thus, less quarter notes and more eighth notes.


## Cyberpunk
A difficult and amorphous genre to define, *cyberpunk* in this project will encompass a wide variety of electronic ambient music. Directly inspired by the music of the movie *Blade Runner* and the game *Ghostrunner*, our genre of *cyberpunk* will be synthesizer-heavy with a sturdy percussive backbone. We want ambient, morphing synths for chords (changing in anything but pitch), with a lean towards clean synths for our melody. 

### Cyberpunk - Rhythm 
It's okay to space out the notes, and we don't need much repetition throughout. Maybe we have a small chance of repeating measures 2/4, but otherwise each measure can stand on its own. We can repeat the first half of measures 2 and 4, we don't need repetition elsewhere. The notes that we want to be played quickly will be repetitive arpeggios, so our "melody" rhythm should be slower, for better atmosphere and ambience.
