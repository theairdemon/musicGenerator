# Genres
To better create specific variations among the music that is generation, it makes sense to make different weighted probabilities for a few genres of music, which will hopefully make it easier to feel like that's the type of song we're listening to.

## Anime
To me, the *anime" genre means something in-between pop, classical, and indie rock. The primary instrument for the melody would be piano and/or violins, with cellos for the harmonies/chords and woodwinds playing secondary melodies on top.

### Anime - Rhythm
The *anime* genre should rhythmically have some repetition between measures, but it's not a guarantee for every song. Verse-to-verse, we want some differences, but we also want to be able to revist previous rhymic ideas later in the song. I think the most imnportant rhytmic repetition will occur in the first half of the measures; this will tie the structure for each verse together quite nicely. We want the fourth measure to have a smaller probability of repeating, as it should be the end of our "breath" for this verse.

To keep things moving, we don't want any 1/2 notes at all. We can retain 1/16 notes, but they shouldn't appear very frequently at all. 1/4 and 1/8 notes can appear with the same frequency, since we know we'll be trying to double-up 1/8 notes.
